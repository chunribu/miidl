### [Getting Started](https://github.com/chunribu/miidl/blob/main/Tutorials.ipynb)

ðŸ‘‹Welcome! 

[ðŸ”—This guide](https://github.com/chunribu/miidl/blob/main/Tutorials.ipynb) will provide you with a specific example that using `miidl` to detect microbial biomarkers of colorectal cancer and predict clinical outcomes. 

After that, you will learn how to use this tool properly.

---
### Installation

```bash
pip install miidl
```
or
```bash
conda install miidl captum -c pytorch -c conda-forge -c bioconda
```

---
### Features

+ One-stop profiling
+ Multiple strategies for biological data
+ More interpretable, not a "black box"

---
### Workflow

#### 1) Quality Control

The very first procedure is filtering features according to a threshold of observation (non-missing) rate (0.3 by default).

#### 2) Normalization

`miidl` offers plenty of normalization methods to transform data and make samples more comparable. 

#### 3) Imputation

By default, this step is inactivated, as `miidl` is designed to solve problems including sparseness. But imputation can be useful in some cases. Commonly used methods are available if needed. 

#### 4) Reshape

The pre-processed data also need to be zero-completed to a certain length, so that a CNN model can be applied.

#### 5) Modeling

A CNN classifier is trained for discrimination. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is needed.

#### 6) Interpretation

[Captum](https://captum.ai/) is dedicated to model interpretability for PyTorch. This step depends heavily on captum.
